## Important Submission Notes
It is important for students to submit the full set of required materials by the deadline. Failure to do so may result in a lower evaluation, as determined by the assessors. Students who fail to submit a presentation video for the interim assessment will receive a Fail grade for the interim assessment, regardless of the submission of the interim report and/or other materials.
