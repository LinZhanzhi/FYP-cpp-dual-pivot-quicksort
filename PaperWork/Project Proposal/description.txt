Since 2007, Java has been using dual-pivot quicksort for nonstable sorting (https://web.archive.org/web/20151002230717/
http://iaroslavski.narod.ru/quicksort/DualPivotQuicksort.pdf),
which has been shown to outperform the previous algorithm
primarily due to better cache utilization
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01138). Despite its success, no
other major languages have adopted this approach yet.
Consider adapting dual-pivot quicksort to other languages
and compare its performance with the existing sorting
libraries in those languages
