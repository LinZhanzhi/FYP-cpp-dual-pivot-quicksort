# Project Summary Generation Instructions

These instructions outline the requirements for the One-page Project Summary submitted at the end of the Capstone Project.

## Core Requirements (Section 5.4)
1.  **Length**: Strictly **One Page**.
2.  **Format**: **MS Word** (.docx).
3.  **Style**: **IEEE Paper Format** (Double column, specific fonts/margins).
    *   Reference: [IEEE Templates](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
4.  **Submission**: Submit to the Capstone Project Submission System.
5.  **Purpose**: Assessment and potential publication in the Capstone Project Summary Booklet.

## Structure (IEEE Format)
Since space is limited to one page, you must be concise.

### 1. Title & Authors
*   Project Title.
*   Student Name & ID.
*   Supervisor Name.

### 2. Abstract
*   A condensed version of your report's abstract (50-100 words).

### 3. Introduction
*   Problem statement and motivation.

### 4. Methodology / System Design
*   High-level overview of the solution.
*   One key diagram (if space permits) is highly recommended.

### 5. Results
*   Key findings or performance metrics.
*   Evidence of success.

### 6. Conclusion
*   Final wrap-up.

### 7. References
*   Limit to 2-3 key references due to space constraints.

## Best Practices
*   **Conciseness is Key**: Every word counts. Remove fluff.
*   **Visual Impact**: If including a figure, ensure it is legible when resized to fit a column.
*   **Strict Formatting**: Follow the IEEE template exactly. Do not change margins or font sizes to squeeze more text in.
*   **Word vs PDF**: Unlike other submissions, this must be in **MS Word** format for editing/compilation purposes.

## AI Generation Guidelines
*   **Summarization**: When asking AI to draft this, provide the full Abstract and Conclusion from the Final Report as input.
*   **Constraint Checking**: Explicitly ask the AI to keep sections short to fit the one-page limit.
