# Interim Report Generation Instructions

These instructions outline how to generate and structure the Interim Report for the Capstone Project. The interim report serves as a checkpoint and a skeleton for the final thesis.

## Core Requirements (Section 5.2)
1.  **Format**: Must be submitted in **PDF** format.
2.  **Submission System**: Submit to the Capstone Project Submission System (NOT Turnitin).
3.  **Content Goal**: It should contain the **skeleton of the final report**.
4.  **Group Projects**:
    *   Each student must submit an **individual** interim report.
    *   Must provide an overview of the whole project but focus on **your own progress** and contribution.
5.  **Length**: Maximum **50 pages** (excluding preamble and appendices).
6.  **Formatting**: Follow "Part 10" requirements for cover and general formatting.

## Recommended Structure
The interim report is essentially a "work-in-progress" version of the final report.

### 1. Preamble
*   **Title Page**: Standard project cover.
*   **Abstract**: Brief summary of the problem, approach, and *current status*.
*   **Table of Contents**.

### 2. Introduction
*   **Background**: Context of the project.
*   **Problem Statement**: What are you solving?
*   **Objectives**: Clear, numbered goals.
*   **Scope**: What is in and out of scope.

### 3. Literature Review
*   Summary of related work, technologies, and research gathered so far.

### 4. Methodology / System Design
*   **Proposed Solution**: High-level architecture or algorithm design.
*   **Tools & Technologies**: What is being used and why.

### 5. Progress & Preliminary Results (Critical Section)
*   **Current Status**: What has been completed?
*   **Individual Contribution**: (For group projects) Explicitly state what *you* have done.
*   **Evidence**: Screenshots, initial data, prototype descriptions, or code snippets.

### 6. Project Plan (Remaining Work)
*   **Gantt Chart / Timeline**: Plan for the second semester (Jan - Apr).
*   **Pending Tasks**: What is left to do?
*   **Challenges**: Potential risks and how to mitigate them.

### 7. Conclusion
*   Brief summary of the project's health and readiness for the final phase.

## Best Practices for a "Good" Report
*   **"Skeleton" Approach**: Even if a section isn't finished, include the heading and a brief description of what *will* be there. Don't leave it blank.
*   **Visuals**: Use diagrams (UML, Flowcharts) to explain the design. A picture is worth a thousand words.
*   **Distinguish Contributions**: In group projects, use phrases like "My specific responsibility was..." or "I implemented the..." to ensure individual assessment is clear.
*   **Professional Tone**: Use formal academic English. Avoid slang.

## AI Generation Guidelines
*   **Context First**: Before generating text, ask the user for their specific progress updates and design details.
*   **No Hallucination**: Do not invent results or data. If data is missing, use placeholders like `[Insert Data Here]`.
*   **Formatting**: Generate content in Markdown that converts easily to a clean PDF format.
