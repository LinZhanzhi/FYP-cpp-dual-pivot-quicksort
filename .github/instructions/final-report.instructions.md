# Final Report Generation Instructions

These instructions outline the requirements and structure for the Final Capstone Project Report. This is the culmination of the year-long project.

## Core Requirements (Section 5.3)
1.  **Format**: Must be submitted in **PDF** format.
2.  **Length**: Maximum **50 pages** (excluding preamble and appendices).
3.  **Group Projects**:
    *   **Individual Submission**: Each student submits their own report.
    *   **Content**: Must provide an overview of the entire project but focus heavily on **your specific contributions**.
    *   **Context**: Explain where your work fits into the bigger picture.
4.  **Turnitin**:
    *   The report **MUST** be submitted to Turnitin.
    *   The generated **Similarity Report (PDF)** must be downloaded and submitted.
5.  **Declaration**:
    *   "Declaration of Originality" (Appendix B) must be signed and submitted as a PDF.
6.  **Formatting**: Follow "Part 10" requirements (Cover page, fonts, margins).

## Recommended Structure
The final report should follow a standard academic thesis structure.

### 1. Preamble
*   **Title Page**: Standard project cover.
*   **Declaration of Originality**.
*   **Abstract**: Complete summary of the problem, solution, and *final results*.
*   **Acknowledgements**.
*   **Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables**.

### 2. Introduction
*   **Background & Motivation**.
*   **Problem Statement**.
*   **Objectives**: Were they met?
*   **Scope**.

### 3. Literature Review
*   Comprehensive review of related work and technologies.

### 4. Methodology / System Design
*   **System Architecture**: High-level design.
*   **Detailed Design**: Database schemas, algorithms, class diagrams.
*   **Justification**: Why were these specific choices made?

### 5. Implementation (Individual Focus)
*   **Key Challenges**: Technical hurdles you overcame.
*   **Code Structure**: Explanation of critical modules.
*   **Screenshots**: Evidence of the working system.
*   *Note: For group projects, clearly distinguish your code from your partners'.*

### 6. Results & Evaluation (Critical)
*   **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests.
*   **Performance Metrics**: Speed, accuracy, load testing results.
*   **User Feedback**: If applicable.
*   **Analysis**: Discuss what the results mean. Do not just present data; analyze it.

### 7. Conclusion & Future Work
*   **Summary of Achievements**.
*   **Limitations**: What could be improved?
*   **Future Directions**.

## Submission Checklist
You must submit THREE separate PDF files:
1.  [ ] **Final Report** (`[Student ID].pdf`)
2.  [ ] **Turnitin Similarity Report**
3.  [ ] **Declaration of Originality Form**

## Best Practices
*   **Evidence-Based**: Every claim about "success" or "performance" must be backed by data or screenshots.
*   **Clarity**: Use tables to summarize comparisons and graphs to visualize data.
*   **Proofreading**: This is a formal academic document. Ensure grammar and spelling are perfect.
*   **References**: Use a consistent citation style (e.g., IEEE or APA) for all references.

## AI Generation Guidelines
*   **Analysis over Description**: When generating text, focus on *why* something works, not just *how* it was built.
*   **Data Integrity**: Never generate fake test results. Use placeholders like `[Insert Test Data]` if real data is not yet available.
*   **Refinement**: Use AI to refine the tone to be "academic and objective."
