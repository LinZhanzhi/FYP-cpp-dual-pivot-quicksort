# Presentation & Video Generation Instructions

These instructions outline the requirements and best practices for creating the Capstone Project presentation slides and the interim presentation video.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Presentation Video (Interim Assessment)
*   **Format**: MP4 file.
*   **Duration**: 10 - 15 minutes. (Strict limit: Max 15 mins).
*   **Resolution**: Minimum 720p.
*   **Identity Verification**:
    *   **Start**: Show your Student ID card clearly at the very beginning.
    *   **During**: Your face must be visible throughout the entire video (e.g., webcam overlay).
*   **Legibility**: Ensure slide fonts are large enough to be read in the video.
*   **Recording Tools**: MS Teams, Zoom, OBS, etc.
    *   *Warning*: If using Zoom, the top right-hand corner of your slides might be covered by the camera view. Design your slides accordingly.

### 2. Presentation Slides (File Submission)
*   **Format**: PDF (Convert your PPT/Keynote to PDF).
*   **Naming Convention**: `[Student ID].pdf` (e.g., `22001234d.pdf`).
*   **Submission Timing**: Submit at the END of the interim and final presentations.

## Recommended Structure (10-15 Minute Video)

1.  **Introduction (1-2 mins)**
    *   Show Student ID.
    *   Project Title & Self-intro.
    *   Problem Statement: What are you solving and why?

2.  **Methodology / Technical Design (3-5 mins)**
    *   System Architecture (Use diagrams).
    *   Key Algorithms or Technologies used.
    *   *Tip: Don't just read bullet points; explain the "how".*

3.  **Progress & Demo (4-6 mins) - CRITICAL**
    *   Show, don't just tell.
    *   Screen recording of the software running (if applicable).
    *   If code isn't ready, show UI mockups or initial data processing.
    *   Highlight your *individual* contribution if in a group.

4.  **Future Work & Conclusion (1-2 mins)**
    *   Plan for the next semester.
    *   Summary of current status.

## Best Practices

### Slide Design
*   **Visuals Over Text**: Use flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and screenshots. Avoid walls of text.
*   **Font Size**: Minimum 24pt for body text.
*   **Zoom-Safe Zone**: Keep the top-right corner empty to avoid being covered by your webcam feed.

### Recording Tips
*   **Audio**: Use a headset or good microphone. Bad audio ruins a presentation.
*   **Lighting**: Ensure your face is well-lit (face the window, don't have it behind you).
*   **Rehearse**: Do a dry run to check timing. 15 minutes goes by fast.
